# If need to change parameters, format it the way exactly the same as it is now: slashes at the end of web url and at the start of directory path, no slashes # at the end of directory paths, all caps for proposal name. If there're multiple proposal IDs, separate them with comma; same for 1m0, 2m0, 0m8 and 0m4
# total available observation times. If there's no observation time for one telescope type, simply type NONE as its input. Reduction level (rlevel) choices 
# are raw/quicklook/reduced, all in lower case, and the date should be in the current format (YYYY-MM-DD). End date should be the last date that one needs 
# data from plus one more day (i.e. if the last date one seeks data from is 2016-01-01, date_end should be 2016-01-02). Frame directory is the directory in 
# which all the data processing take place; final frame directory is the directory which all the frames will be moved to once they are done time calculation # and are ready for use by other programs; finalproducts_directory is the directory which all products except frames will eventually be moved to when program # finishes executing. Obstype parameter may take several values (now only support EXPOSE and CATALOG), separated by comma and are all in upper case, the 
# inputs for obstype are universal for all proposals (different from inputs for proposal and total_time, which are proposal exclusive). All directories must
# be created before running the program.

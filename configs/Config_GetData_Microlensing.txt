# If need to change parameters, format it the way exactly the same as it is now: slashes at the end of web url and at the start of directory path, no slashes 
# at the end of directory paths, all caps for proposal name. If there're multiple proposal IDs, separate them with comma; same for 1m0 and 2m0 total 
# available observation times. If there's no 2m0 observation time, simply type NONE as its input. Reduction level (rlevel) choices are raw/quicklook/reduced, 
# all in lower case, and the date should be in the current format (YYYY-MM-DD). End date should be the last date that one needs data from plus one more day 
# (i.e. if the last date one seeks data from is 2016-01-01, date_end should be 2016-01-02). Frame directory is the directory in which all the data processing 
# take place, and final frame directory is the directory which all the frames will be moved to once they are done time calculation and are ready for use by 
# other programs.

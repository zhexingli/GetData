# If need to change parameters, format it the way exactly the same as it is now: slashes at the end of web url and at the start of directory path, no slashes 
# at the end of directory paths, all caps for proposal name, reduction level (rlevel) choices are raw/quicklook/reduced, all in lower case, and the date 
# should be in the current format (YYYY-MM-DD). End date should be the last date that one needs data from plus one more day (i.e. if the last date one seeks 
# data from is 2016-01-01, the end date should be 2016-01-02). Frame directory is the directory in which all the data processing take place, and final frame 
# directory is the directory which all the frames will be moved to once they are done time calculation and are ready for use by other programs.
